# Contributing

Thanks for looking. Sepia is early, so the most useful contributions right now are reviews of the protocol docs and the program.

1. Open an issue before large changes, so we can agree on the approach.
2. Program: `cargo fmt && anchor build && anchor test`. New behaviour needs a test in `tests/sepia.ts`.
3. SDK: `cd sdk && npm test`. Keep zero runtime dependencies beyond `@noble/*`. Anything that signs must be checked against an independent ed25519 verifier in the tests.
4. Docs: plain language, short sentences, real numbers. If a design choice has a privacy cost, say so in `docs/privacy-model.md`.
5. Security issues go through [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not public issues.
